Our project is to design a website where the information of the books has detailed information,
where users can easily become members and review the books, give them points and comment.
In our site admin can add and delete new books authors and publishers while users can only access
information about them. At the same time, users can add their favorite books and publishers to their profiles,
and edit and delete their profiles. Our site can be considered as the IMDB of books.
